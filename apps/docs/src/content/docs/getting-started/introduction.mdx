 TayTay UI is a suite of tools and packages focused on providing great user and developer experience. 
 TayTay UI provides flexibility when needed by providing configurations for multiple styling soluitions and user interface frameworks, and also provides
 fully managed components with context-aware theming.

 ## TayTay CSS

 Instead of being locked into a styling solution of our choice, developers get to choose the CSS framework that fits best for their solution. TayTay CSS provides configs for all
 multiple CSS solutions like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Vanilla-Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/), 
 [Panda](https://panda-css.com/), and [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), 
 and [vanilla CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

 Don't see your favorite framework, or need to extend your config? TayTay CSS generates configs using Design Tokens, and can easily be extended to meet your team's needs.
